# React + AFrame + TypeScript Boilerplate

Features:

- [ReactJS](https://code.facebook.com/projects/176988925806765/react/): the famous JavaScript framework
- [A-Frame](https://aframe.io): Javascript framework for 3D and Virtual Reality based in [ThreeJS](https://www.threejs.org)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org): provides type system to JavaScript
- [React Router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/): It allows navigation between 3D scenes whitout the need of loading all the A-frame library code each time a new scene is loaded. Only code needed for each new scene is loaded. which gives a smooth and fast experience. This is new to A-frame development where all library code is loaded between scenes navigation.
- This project is based on [create-react-app-typescript](https://github.com/wmonk/create-react-app-typescript)
